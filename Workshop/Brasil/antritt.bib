    abstract = { Scientific results should not just be ‘repeatable’ (replicable in the same laboratory under identical conditions), but also ‘reproducible’ (replicable in other laboratories under similar conditions). Results should also, if possible, be ‘robust’ (replicable under a wide range of conditions). The reproducibility and robustness of only a small fraction of published biomedical results has been tested; furthermore, when reproducibility is tested, it is often not found. This situation is termed ‘the reproducibility crisis', and it is one the most important issues facing biomedicine. This crisis would be solved if it were possible to automate reproducibility testing. Here, we describe the semi-automated testing for reproducibility and robustness of simple statements (propositions) about cancer cell biology automatically extracted from the literature. From 12 260 papers, we automatically extracted statements predicted to describe experimental results regarding a change of gene expression in response to drug treatment in breast cancer, from these we selected 74 statements of high biomedical interest. To test the reproducibility of these statements, two different teams used the laboratory automation system Eve and two breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231). Statistically significant evidence for repeatability was found for 43 statements, and significant evidence for reproducibility/robustness in 22 statements. In two cases, the automation made serendipitous discoveries. The reproduced/robust knowledge provides significant insight into cancer. We conclude that semi-automated reproducibility testing is currently achievable, that it could be scaled up to generate a substantive source of reliable knowledge and that automation has the potential to mitigate the reproducibility crisis. }

	abstract = {The lack of reproducibility of scientific research undermines public confidence in science and leads to the misuse of resources when researchers attempt to replicate and extend fallacious research findings. Using recent developments in Bayesian hypothesis testing, a root cause of nonreproducibility is traced to the conduct of significance tests at inappropriately high levels of significance. Modifications of common standards of evidence are proposed to reduce the rate of nonreproducibility of scientific research by a factor of 5 or greater.Recent advances in Bayesian hypothesis testing have led to the development of uniformly most powerful Bayesian tests, which represent an objective, default class of Bayesian hypothesis tests that have the same rejection regions as classical significance tests. Based on the correspondence between these two classes of tests, it is possible to equate the size of classical hypothesis tests with evidence thresholds in Bayesian tests, and to equate P values with Bayes factors. An examination of these connections suggest that recent concerns over the lack of reproducibility of scientific studies can be attributed largely to the conduct of significance tests at unjustifiably high levels of significance. To correct this problem, evidence thresholds required for the declaration of a significant finding should be increased to 25{\textendash}50:1, and to 100{\textendash}200:1 for the declaration of a highly significant finding. In terms of classical hypothesis tests, these evidence standards mandate the conduct of tests at the 0.005 or 0.001 level of significance.},

abstract = "In data monitoring of long-term clinical trials, it is routine to consider the question of whether a trial should be terminated before its scheduled end. Termination may seem reasonable either because it appears that the null hypothesis (H0) is likely to be disproved at the end of the trial or, even under optimistic assumptions, it is quite unlikely to be disproved. This idea has recently been formalized and characterized (with respect to Type 1 and Type 2 error) by Lan, Simon, and Halperin [Comm Stat in press]; their results provide a quantitative rationale for using as a monitoring tool, the conditional probability given current results and particular hypotheses that the treatment group will be superior (in the statistical sense) at the designed end of the trial. If the conditional probability under H0 is sufficiently high, rejection of H0 is indicated; if the conditional probability under Ha is sufficiently low, acceptance of H0 is indicated. Details of the implementation of this idea are considered for the case where the outcome variable is dichotomous and the statistic comparing the two groups at the trial's end is simply the standardized observed difference in proportions of events. The case of simultaneous entry and no competing risk is considered in detail with subsequent discussion of the alterations required if staggered entry and/or competing risk are relevant; simplifications which are possible in the case of staggered entry are described. Unsurprisingly, our results depend on assumptions made about further experience. Possible approaches to the extrapolation problem thus created are briefly described."

 abstract = {A phase II clinical trial is designed to gather data to help decide whether an experimental treatment has sufficient effectiveness to justify further study. In a one-arm trial with dichotomous outcome, we wish to test a simple null hypothesis on the Bernoulli parameter against a one-sided alternative in a sample of N patients. It is advisable to have a rule to terminate the trial early when evidence accumulates that the treatment is ineffective. Predictive probabilities based on the binomial distribution and beta and uniform prior distributions for the binomial parameter are found to be useful as the basis of group sequential designs. Size, power and average sample size for these designs are discussed. A process for the specification of an early termination plan, advice on the quantification of prior beliefs, and illustrative examples are included.},

If something is new, we need to encode it as a memory distinct from already stored episodes, using a process known as pattern separation. If familiar, it can be used to reactivate a previously stored memory, by a process known as pattern completion. To orchestrate these conflicting processes, current models propose that the episodic memory system uses environmental cues to establish processing biases that favor either pattern separation during encoding or pattern completion during retrieval. To assess this theory, we measured how people{\textquoteright}s memory formation and decisions are influenced by their recent engagement in episodic encoding and retrieval. We found that the recent encoding of novel objects improved subsequent identification of subtle changes, a task thought to rely on pattern separation. Conversely, recent retrieval of old objects increased the subsequent integration of stored information into new memories, a process thought to rely on pattern completion. These experiments provide behavioral evidence that episodic encoding and retrieval evoke lingering biases that influence subsequent mnemonic processing.},

    abstract = { To overcome the frequently debated crisis of confidence, replicating studies is becoming increasingly more common. Multiple frequentist and Bayesian measures have been proposed to evaluate whether a replication is successful, but little is known about which method best captures replication success. This study is one of the first attempts to compare a number of quantitative measures of replication success with respect to their ability to draw the correct inference when the underlying truth is known, while taking publication bias into account. Our results show that Bayesian metrics seem to slightly outperform frequentist metrics across the board. Generally, meta-analytic approaches seem to slightly outperform metrics that evaluate single studies, except in the scenario of extreme publication bias, where this pattern reverses. }

Some comments/questions about the workshop in Brasil

- Make the slides of the lecture/workshop available on gitlab so that users can refer to that during the workshop. (CM; on monday or tuesday before the conference)


- Update vignette (done) 
- Update news file (done) 

- Try to install the package on Linux, Mac, and Windows (done, list of problems): 
	- latex is required to build the vignette, so maybe without the vignette and put in on  GitLab? 
	- keep in mind: Lisa (windows) had a problem installing the package because she missed the "RTools" package

	- with Francesca (Windows): disable vignette building 
	
- Send e-mail to Marcos so that he tells participants to bring a computer and have a recent R version installed
- Tell them during Leo's talk to bring computer + install R + try to install package and come to me if problem


- How do we split?

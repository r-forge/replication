CM, Aug 8 2022 - Debriefing of the Workshop given in Gramado (Brasil) during SINPAE conference: 

Because most of them were professors and we were a small group, we didn't make them do the exercises. Instead I presented the solutions. This worked well and generated a lot of interesting discussion. 
--> Keep this is mind for next time, and think whether we want to do it the standard way or like in Gramado.

Some comments/questions about the workshop in Brasil

- I think it is good to keep a small introduction on replication in the workshop, as not everyone might have been present during Leo's talk.
- Make the slides of the lecture available on gitlab/github so that users can refer to that during the workshop.
- Update vignette 
- Two.sided pM in theory? ok
- Try to install the package on Linux, Mac, and Windows
- MA: random or fixed effect MA?

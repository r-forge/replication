Some comments/questions about the workshop in Brasil

- Make the slides of the lecture/workshop available on gitlab so that users can refer to that during the workshop.
- Update vignette 
- Try to install the package on Linux, Mac, and Windows 
- seems to be problematic with Windows (obviously) - solution with Francesca: disable vignette building
- Send e-mail to Marcos so that he tells participants to bring a computer and have a recent R version installed
- How do we split?
